Theres a little bug which i understand but am super lazy to fix ,Bfs to work properly  
needs a proper organised pattern of queue which i was lazy to implement and just modified my queue ds that i build earlier to smiplify u used dfs in bfs which is kind of stupid but it is easy fix so that i dont need to change whole que code again .
